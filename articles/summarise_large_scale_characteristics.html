</h2>
<p>In the previous vignette we have seen how we can use the
CohortCharacteristics package to summarise a set of pre-specified
characteristics of a study cohort. These characteristics included
patient demographics like age and sex, and also concept sets and cohorts
that we defined. Another, often complimentary, way that we can approach
characterising a study cohort is by simply summarising all clinical
events we see for them in some window around their index date (cohort
entry).</p>
<p>To show how large scale characterisation can work we’ll first create
a first-ever ankle sprain study cohort using the Eunomia synthetic
data.</p>

</h2>
<p>To summarise our cohort of individuals with an ankle sprain we will
look at their records in three tables of the OMOP CDM
(<em>condition_occurrence</em>, <em>procedure_occurrence</em>, and
<em>drug_exposure</em>) over two time windows (any time prior to their
index date, and on index date). For conditions and procedures we will
identify whether someone had a new record starting in the time window.
Meanwhile, for drug exposures we will consider whether they had a new or
ongoing record in the period.</p>
<p>Lastly, but important to note, we are only going to only return
results for concepts for which at least 10% of the study cohort had a
record.</p>

we can see we have identified numerous concepts for which at least
10% of our study population had a record. Often with larger cohorts and
real patient-level data we will obtain many times more results when
running large scale characterisation. One option we have to help
summarise our results is to pick out the most frequent concepts. Here,
for example, we select the top 5 concepts.</p>

<p>Like when summarising pre-specified patient characteristics, we can
also get stratified results when summarising large scale

stratified by sex (which we add as an additional column to our cohort
table using the PatientProfiles package).</p>
